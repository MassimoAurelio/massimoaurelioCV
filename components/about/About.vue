        Hi, I'm Brian, born in Honduras and currently living in Houston. I have
        been coding for 5 years. As a software engineer, I specialize in
        full-stack web development and product design.
      </p>

      <p>
        In addition to coding, I create content on my channel, covering all
        things technology, coding vlogs, and personal development topics.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I'm not at my desk I am probably lifting weights, playing soccer,
        or at a local coffee shop :]
